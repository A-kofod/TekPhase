# TekPhase

## Vector plotting program for quick visualization of electrical systems.

## Alpha release

This is an early pre-release version. TekPhase is primarily an educational project developed by the author, a student of Marine Engineering and Technology Management, with the goal of learning Python, debugging, error handling, documentation, and release management.
The program utilizes `tkinter` and `matplotlib` to provide a graphical interface and vector plots.

The program produces mathematically consistent vector plots. The interface is functional rather than polished, and some features may feel clumsy - to be improved in future updates.

A complete guide and full documentation will be provided in a future update to the `README`.

## How to download

The application is available as a standalone `.exe`. No additional software is required to run TekPhase.

Older versions are available in the repository, but it is recommended to download the newest version.
Go to the repository → Releases → select the latest `TekPhase.exe`.

The application does not yet support updating or autoupdating, meaning upon a new release, the user will have to download the newest version and replace the older version. 

## Scope

TekPhase is built specifically for students of Marine Engineering and Technology Management (Maskinmester), and introductory electronics students.

It is not intended to replace professional software like Mathcad or MATLAB, but provides a quick and lightweight way to visualize common electrical vector formations.

TekPhase is a vector plotter, not a calculator.

## Rights

The program is free to use and distribute. Please respect the intended educational use of the software.

## Future updates
Future updates will consist of, but are not limited to:
- Full user guide in `README`. 
- Migration to PyQt
- "Resulting Vector" calculations.
- Improved labelling
- Harmonic currents
